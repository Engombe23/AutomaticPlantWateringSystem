# Automatic Plant WateringSystem

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A prototype of an Automatic Plant Watering System. The plant is watered depending on its condition.</p>
<p>This was a project I worked on in my first year of university with a team of 5.</p>
<p>The equipment being used (shown in the poster belowðŸ‘‡) was borrowed from the university so it had to be returned back once finished.</p>
<p>The code only runs with the equipment and the Arduino.</p>
